-- Using chains directly in the Java code is problematic: To compile the chains, we need to be able to raed the component .class files. But to compile classes that use these chains, possibly even components, we need the chains. This is a circular dependency. This means that the problem probably needs to be fixed with a "chain factory" that instantiates chains it does not yet know.
